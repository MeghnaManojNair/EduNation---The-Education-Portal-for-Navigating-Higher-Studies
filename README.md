# EduNation: The Education Portal for Navigating Higher Studies
EduNation is a comprehensive educational web platform developed using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Ajax, and jQuery. The goal is simple: to assist students in discovering and evaluating top universities that match their interests. The application prioritizes user security by implementing a robust MySQL database to securely store and manage user credentials and preferences. This infrastructure enables personalized features such as customized college priority lists and user reviews, empowering users in their decision-making process. To ensure a seamless user experience, I've optimized EduNation to handle extensive interactions, incorporating features like prioritized wishlists and review posting capabilities. A focus on efficiency means faster load times and enhanced user satisfaction.
